This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

# Reflection


    1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
    - Just by clicking on files in lib and spec folders and running some tests. 
    
    2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
    - Not this time. It seemed straight forward and well laid out
    
    3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
    - Seemed straight forward and laid out in a proper way. The on file that was new to me was spec_helper which I thought was cool. All the spec files pointed to it and then it had a list of 'reqire' at the top.
